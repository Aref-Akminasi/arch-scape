# Arch Scape

Arch Scape is a template for architecture offices, designed in Figma and built in HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript. It is created in a responsive and dynamic way, allowing the end user to customize it easily.

This project was a collaboration with the designer 'Padre Loo,' who handled the infrastructure of the design and made it ready for development.
